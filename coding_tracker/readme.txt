This is a learning C# CLI program where you log your coding sessions.

The guidelines for the project are set by C# Academy (https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/13/coding-tracker)

Features
--------
The program features an arrow navigation menu using Spectre Console and a simple SQLite database logging of date and time.

Thoughts
--------
The project was very straight forward and a nice way to brush up on my date/time string interpolation skills.
The use of spectre console can be game changing if you are trying to make an appealing cli program.
Dapper is also very convinient to use, even though I only scrapped the surface of what its capabilities are.


A big thanks to the C# academy for creating the projects, it's a massive help.
